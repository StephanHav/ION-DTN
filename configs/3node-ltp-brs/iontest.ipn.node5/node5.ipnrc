# Node 5 has a BRSC loopback route (i.e., it sends bundles to itself via
# the BRS server at node 10).  It also talks to node 10 by BRSC to
# the BRS server at node 10.
# It talks to node 7 by LTP/UDP/IP.
# For all other nodes it uses a default route: via node 7.  There is no
# dynamic route computation.
